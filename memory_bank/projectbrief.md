## Project Overview

there are three existing folders, real-tick, spp and final
we will build an app that copies the files from 'spp' that also exists in 'real-tick', to the 'final' folder, it will be built in python, with a GUI, and it will be a simple app that will be used by a single user, it has to be able to run on Windows 10 and 11 without any dependencies, so the use don't need to install anything, the app will be a single executable file.

## Key Goals
- We need a GUI for some options, for now, the options will be:
    - real-tick folder, it can have any name, we need to track it so it will act as the real-tick folder
    - spp folder, it can have any name, we need to track it so it will act as the spp folder
    - final folder, it can have any name, we need to track it so it will act as the final folder
