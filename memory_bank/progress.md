# Progress Update (Refactor & Cleanup)

- Renamed all main files and references to 'copy-strategies' for consistency.
- Removed unused and legacy files (old scripts, build artifacts, unused configs).
- Updated build process to use a single .spec file and a clear build script.
- Ensured the executable and all references use the new name.
